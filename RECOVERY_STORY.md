# The Recovery Story - Tissues Not Required

## The Disaster

It’s Monday morning.

Your Docker host is dead.
No SSH. No containers. No hope.

Something broke. Something always breaks.

This is why Container Monkey exists.

---

## Before Everything Went Wrong (Past You Was Smart)

Before today, Container Monkey was quietly doing boring things:

* Running scheduled backups
* Saving volumes, networks, and config
* Storing backups off-host in a shared S3 vault (not on the host that just died)

Past You deserves a medal.

---

## The Recovery (Present You Is Calm Somehow)

### 1️⃣ New Host

* Fresh OS
* Docker installed
* No containers
* No panic

### 2️⃣ Install Container Monkey

It starts empty.
That’s good.

### 3️⃣ Point It at Your Backups

You connect Container Monkey to your shared S3 vault.

Container Monkey responds with:

> “Here are your backups. You’re not doomed.”

### 4️⃣ Pick a Restore Point

You choose:

> “The one from before everything exploded.”

### 5️⃣ Click Restore

Container Monkey:

* Recreates networks
* Restores volumes
* Rebuilds containers
* Starts things in a sensible order

No guesswork. No dark magic.

---

## And Suddenly… It Works

Your services are back.

From the outside it looks like:

> “Oh, the server rebooted.”

You know better.

---

## Important Fine Print (Honesty Time)

Container Monkey:

* Won’t fix broken apps
* Won’t magically fix bad images
* Won’t replace proper database backups

What it *will* do:

> Get you from "everything is on fire" to "okay, that was survivable" — reliably and repeatably.
